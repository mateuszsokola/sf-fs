## Rules

- The `create_employee` function is used by several services by different teams within the organization. The API must remain reverse-compatible.
- Do NOT use any external libraries.
- Feel free to ask questions.

## Tasks

1. Our new intern wrote a controller responsible for creating new employees. Unfortunately, all unit tests are failing - try to fix them.
2. A senior software engineer complained about data validation. Validation rules seem to be duplicated, the code is not reusable and we want to use it for other controllers. It must be refactored - propose a refactoring plan.

## How to run?

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
